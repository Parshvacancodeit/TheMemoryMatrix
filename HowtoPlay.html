       <p>Remember, The Memory Matrix is a game that requires focus and concentration. With practice, you can develop your ability to remember longer sequences and achieve higher scores. Enjoy the challenge and have fun playing!</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Computer will play a sequence of lights and sounds by illuminating the colored buttons in a particular order. Pay close attention to the sequence as you'll need to repeat it.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Repeat the sequence: Once Computer has finished playing the sequence, it's your turn to repeat it. Press the buttons in the same order as Computer did. For example, if Computer played a sequence of red, green, blue, you would need to press the corresponding buttons in that order.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Continue playing: As the game progresses, computer will keep adding steps to the sequence, making it longer and more challenging. Your objective is to remember and repeat the increasingly complex patterns accurately.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The game continues until you make an incorrect move. At that point, computer will play the incorrect sound, and the game will end. To improve your performance, play the game repeatedly to enhance your memory and pattern recognition skills.</li>
